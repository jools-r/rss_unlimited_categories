h1. Unlimited article categories in Textpattern

h3. rss_unlimited_categories

rss_unlimited_categories enables you to assign an unlimited number of categories to an article so that you're not limited to the default two categories provided by Textpattern.

The plugin adds a multiple select list to your _Txp › Content › Write_ tab to enable the selection of unlimited categories.

It also includes several public side tags to display the categories and list articles by category and an admin tab to set plugin preferences.

h2. Installation and Setup

# Simply install and enable the plugin. The plugin will automatically install a new table that relates articles to categories.
# Navigate to the _Txp › Content › Write_ tab and you'll find a new multiple select list above the standard Textpattern category selection.
# For existing sites, you can copy your current article/category assignments to the new category table structure using the following SQL statements:

bc. INSERT INTO textpattern_category (article_id, category_id)
SELECT t.id, c.id FROM textpattern t
LEFT JOIN txp_category c on t.category1 = c.name
WHERE c.type = 'article' and t.category1 != '';

bc. INSERT INTO textpattern_category (article_id, category_id)
SELECT t.id, c.id FROM textpattern t
LEFT JOIN txp_category c on t.category2 = c.name
WHERE c.type = 'article' and t.category2 != '';


h2. Plugin tags

All of the tags use the new category table created by this plugin instead of the standard Textpattern category 1 and 2 fields. To organise categories, use the plugin's  collection of tags in place of Textpattern's own category tags:

* *rss_uc_filedunder* – Lists all categories assigned to the current article.
* *rss_uc_cloud* – Display a weighted list of all categories as a tag cloud.
* *rss_uc_list* – Display a list of all categories with the number of posts in each.
* *rss_uc_article_list* – Lists articles by category. This is a replacement for the standard Textpattern article list tags.
* *rss_uc_related* – Lists related articles by category. This is a replacement for the standard Textpattern related article tag that uses the unlimited category tables instead of the standard Textpattern category 1 and 2 fields.
* *rss_sct_permlink* – Builds a permlink in /section/category/title format. This is used in place of the standard Textpattern permlink tag.
* *rss_uc_count* – Displays the number of articles assigned to a given category.
* *rss_if_article_uc* – Conditional tag that tells if a particular category is assigned to an article. This is a replacement for the standard Textpattern if_article_category tag.
